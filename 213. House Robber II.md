# Question

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle**. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
             because they are adjacent houses.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

# Algorithm

Before this problem, maybe you can see [198. House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/). 
You need to noticed All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle**. 

For example, The circle is

```
0 -  1  -  2  -  3
|                | 
n - n-1 - n-2 - ...
```

The solution is now the **maximum** of:

1. Rob houses 0 to n - 2;
2. Rob houses 1 to n - 1.

public:
    int rob_helper(vector<int>& nums, int left, int right) {
        int a = 0;
        int b = 0;

        for(int i=left; i<=right; i++){
            if(i%2==0){
                a = max(a+nums[i], b);
            }
            else{
                b = max(b+nums[i], a);
            }
        }

        return max(a,b);
    }
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty())
            return 0;
        if (nums.size() == 1)
            return nums[0];
        int res1 = rob_helper(nums, 0, nums.size()-2);
        int res2 = rob_helper(nums, 1, nums.size()-1);
        
        return res1>res2?res1:res2;
    }
};

```

**Java**
```java

        int a = 0;
        int b = 0;
        
        for(int i=left; i<=right; i++){
            if(i%2==0){
                a = Math.max(a+nums[i], b);
            }
            else{

            }
        }
        
        return Math.max(a,b);        
    }
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null)
            return 0;
        if (nums.length == 1)
            return nums[0];
        
        int res1 = rob_helper(nums, 0, nums.length-2);
        int res2 = rob_helper(nums, 1, nums.length-1);
        
        return Math.max(res1, res2);
    }
}
